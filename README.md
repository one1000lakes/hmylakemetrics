# Hmylakemetrics

Simple scripts for sending Harmony ONE validator node and backup node performance data to web server and visualize data. For example smartstake.io shows performance data of validator in summary but it doesn't give information about how primary node is performing compared to backup node. With this tool it's easy to visualize both nodes separately.
